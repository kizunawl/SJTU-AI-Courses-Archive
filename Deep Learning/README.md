## Task 1
Train a model to fit an arbitrary function. 

Given a function, pick a suitable range and sample 1000 points in this range. 800 of them are training set and the rest 200 are testing set.  

Detailed in the **first edition** of homework requirement.

## Task 2
Classification problem on CIFAR-10. 

Furthermore, only perserve 10\% of the images with label 0~4. Train your model on the unbalanced trainging set. Improve your model to raise its performance.

## Task 3
Classfication problem on MNIST with RNN.

Detailed in the **second edition** of homework requirement. 

## Task 4
Construct a neural network as you could to solve jigsaw puzzle problem. You can refer to the construction of [DeepPermNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02729).
